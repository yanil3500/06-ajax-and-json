// constructor function. Note: it is NOT on the prototype. In JavaScript, functions are themselves
// objects, which means we can add properties/values to them at any time. In this case, we have
// a key/value pair to track, that relates to ALL of the Article objects, so it does not belong on
// the prototype, as that would only be relevant to a single instantiated Article.
